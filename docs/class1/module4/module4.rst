Module 4: BIG-IP Template Creation for VMware (DHCP and IP Pools/Static)
===========================

**Goal:**

In this module, you will learn how to create BIG-IP templates in VMware for VE creation.
Starting in BIG-IQ v7.0, you can provision a new BIG-IP image from a template. This is tested on VMware vCenter v6.5, but should also work on later versions.
